# This document explains how to launch a dedicated server for The Forest.


# Installing and launching the dedicated server app
In the Library tab select Tools. Locate The Forest Dedicated Server and install it.
If launching from Steam does not result in the server showing up in the Internet server list, try launching it directly from the executable or a shortcut instead.

# You can download the tool either through the Steam tool section, or SteamCMD if you would like to avoid signing into steam entirely!

Note: Running a server silently in background can be achieved by launching it with -batchmode as command line parameter.


# Configuring
There are 2 ways to configure the dedicated server:
Using command line parameters.
Using the Server.cfg file.
Note: Command line parameters overwrite matching entries defined in the config file.
